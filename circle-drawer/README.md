# 7GUIs Circle Drawer for Feathers UI

Using [Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) and [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) to build the _Circle Drawer_ task from [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis).

## Live demo

A build of the [_7guis-circle-drawer_ sample](https://feathersui.com/samples/haxe-openfl/7guis-circle-drawer/) is hosted on the Feathers UI website, and it may be viewed in any modern web browser.

## Run locally

This project includes an [_project.xml_](https://lime.software/docs/project-files/xml-format/) file that configures all options for [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/). This file makes it easy to build from the command line, and many IDEs can parse this file to configure a Haxe project to use OpenFL.

### Prerequisites

- [Install Haxe 4.0.0 or newer](https://haxe.org/download/).
- [Install Feathers UI from Haxelib](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/installation/)

### Command Line

Run the [**openfl**](https://www.openfl.org/learn/haxelib/docs/tools/) tool in your terminal:

```sh
haxelib run openfl test html5
```

In addition to `html5`, other supported targets include `windows`, `mac`, `linux`, `android`, and `ios`. See [Lime Command Line Tools: Basic Commands](https://lime.software/docs/command-line-tools/basic-commands/) for complete details about the available commands.
